Goals:
-> Backups:
---> complete backup
---> differential backup
---> (dated backups, assuming some external mechanism (e.g. cron or systemd is invoking this program regularly)
-> Preemptive warnings, i.e.: notification of some (user-)email, if the next backup is expected to exceed the filesystem capacity
-> fancy color outputs
-> Many Screenshots in README
-> Good source code documentation (amount e.g. at least: 50 letters for each function, 20 letters for every loop, 50 for each regular expression)



Further goals (i.e. non-goals):
-> incremental backups
-> managing of regularity
---> automatic generation of crontab rules
---> automatic generation of systemd-rules
-> colorful window boxes
-> using multiple programming languages (e.g. bash)
-> creating ansible recipes/commands
-> supporting use cases of people I have not met
-> Issues pertaining additions to the aforementioned goals.
